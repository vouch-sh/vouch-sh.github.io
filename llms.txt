# Vouch

> Vouch is an open-source credential broker that replaces long-lived secrets (AWS keys, SSH keys, GitHub PATs, registry tokens) with short-lived credentials after FIDO2 hardware verification. One YubiKey tap, up to 8 hours of access, full audit trail.

Vouch eliminates static secrets across your development workflow. It federates identity through OIDC, so every credential is tied to a verified hardware key and expires automatically. No more key rotation scripts, no more offboarding checklists, no more secrets in config files.

## Documentation


- [Getting Started](https://vouch.sh/docs/getting-started/): Install the Vouch CLI, enroll your YubiKey, and replace static secrets with hardware-backed credentials in minutes.

- [AWS](https://vouch.sh/docs/aws/): Stop distributing long-lived AWS access keys. Use OIDC federation to get temporary STS credentials backed by a YubiKey.

- [AWS Multi-Account](https://vouch.sh/docs/aws-multi-account/): Deploy Vouch OIDC federation across multiple AWS accounts with Organizations, StackSets, and SCPs.

- [SSH Certificates](https://vouch.sh/docs/ssh/): Eliminate authorized_keys management. Vouch issues SSH certificates that expire in 8 hours — no key distribution, no offboarding checklist.
