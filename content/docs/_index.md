Vouch replaces the static secrets your team manages today — AWS access keys, SSH keys, GitHub PATs, registry passwords — with short-lived credentials backed by a YubiKey. One tap, up to 8 hours of access, full audit trail.

**New to Vouch?** Start with the [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started/) guide to install the CLI and enroll your YubiKey.
